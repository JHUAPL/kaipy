This file contains notes for the build process of kaipy on ReadTheDocs

First you need to have sphinx and the RTD Theme installed

pip install sphinx
pip install sphinx-rtd-theme
pip install sphinxcontrib-autoprogram

sphinx-quickstart has already been run from the docs directory to create
the starting point for the documentation.  

We have made source part of the repo, but not made build part of the repo.
This choice was made because RTD reconstructs the build directory during install process

All docstrings must follow Google Style so that the napolean option will work with autodoc

sphinx-apidoc -o source ../kaipy has already been run from the docs directory, 
but this might need to be run again as modules are added to kaipy.

To build documenation you go to docs and
make clean
make html
